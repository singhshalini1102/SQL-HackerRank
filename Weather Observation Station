Station 1:
Query a list of CITY and STATE from the STATION table.

SELECT CITY, STATE FROM STATION


Station 3:

Query a list of CITY names from STATION with even ID numbers only. You may print the results in any order, but must exclude duplicates from your answer.

SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION
WHERE ID%2 = 0


Station 4:

Let N be the number of CITY entries in STATION, and let N' be the number of distinct CITY names in STATION; query the value of N-N' from STATION. In other words, find the difference between the total number of CITY entries in the table and the number of distinct CITY entries in the table.

SELECT COUNT(CITY)-COUNT(DISTINCT CITY) FROM STATION


Station 5:

Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.

SELECT top 1 CITY, LEN(CITY) FROM STATION ORDER BY LEN(CITY), CITY ASC
SELECT top 1 CITY, LEN(CITY) FROM STATION ORDER BY LEN(CITY) desc


Station 6:

Query the list of CITY names starting with vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, or u) from STATION. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION
WHERE CITY LIKE 'a%' or CITY LIKE 'e%' OR CITY LIKE 'i%' OR CITY LIKE 'o%' OR CITY LIKE 'u%'


Station 7:

Query the list of CITY names ending with vowels (a, e, i, o, u) from STATION. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION
WHERE CITY LIKE '%a' or CITY LIKE '%e' OR CITY LIKE '%i' OR CITY LIKE '%o' OR CITY LIKE '%u'


Station 8:

Query the list of CITY names from STATION which have vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, and u) as both their first and last characters. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION
WHERE (CITY LIKE 'a%' or CITY LIKE 'e%' OR CITY LIKE 'i%' OR CITY LIKE 'o%' OR CITY LIKE 'u%') AND
(CITY LIKE '%a' or CITY LIKE '%e' OR CITY LIKE '%i' OR CITY LIKE '%o' OR CITY LIKE '%u')


Station 9:

Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not start with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION
WHERE SUBSTRING(CITY,1,1) NOT IN ('a','e','i','o','u')


Station 10:

Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not end with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION
WHERE SUBSTRING(CITY,LEN(CITY),1) NOT IN ('a','e','i','o','u')


Station 11:

Query the list of CITY names from STATION that either do not start with vowels or do not end with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION
WHERE SUBSTRING(CITY,1,1) NOT IN ('a','e','i','o','u') OR SUBSTRING(CITY,LEN(CITY),1) NOT IN ('a','e','i','o','u')


Station 12:

Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not start with vowels and do not end with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION
WHERE SUBSTRING(CITY,1,1) NOT IN ('a','e','i','o','u') AND SUBSTRING(CITY,LEN(CITY),1) NOT IN ('a','e','i','o','u')
