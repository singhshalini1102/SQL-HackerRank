Problem:

Write a query to print all prime numbers less than or equal to 1000. Print your result on a single line, and use the ampersand (&) character as your separator (instead of a space).
For example, the output for all prime numbers <=10 would be:
2&3&5&7

Solution:

DECLARE @prime INT = 2
DECLARE @num INT
DECLARE @counter INT
WHILE (@prime <= 1000)
BEGIN
    SET @num = 1
    SET @counter = 0
    WHILE (@num < @prime)
    BEGIN
        IF (@prime % @num = 0)
        SET @counter = @counter +1
    END
    IF (@counter <= 2)
    PRINT CONCAT(@prime, '&')
END
